# 278. First Bad Version

### [**Easy**]

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
Since each version is developed based on the previous version,
all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one,
which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool `isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether
version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version.

## Approach

Use a binary search to iterate through each version because it would be faster
than a linear search. Search until we find the bad version and return it.

## My Solution

````python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        start = 1
        end = n
        
        while (start < end):
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid) and not isBadVersion(mid-1):
                return mid
            elif isBadVersion(mid): 
                end = mid
            else: 
                start = mid + 1
        
        return start;
