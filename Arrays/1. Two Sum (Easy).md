# 1. Two Sum 

### [**EASY**]

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Approach

Brute force approach that is not that the best in solving this problem in terms of time complexity 
because it uses a double loop. 

Use two loops: the first one keeps track of the index, and the second one will loop 
through the elements inside the array. If we find two numbers that add up to the 
target, then return it. 

## My Solution

````java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int index = 0;
        int firstIndex = nums[0];

        while (index < nums.length) {
            for (int i = index + 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
                if (firstIndex + nums[i] == target) {
                    return new int[]{index, i};
                }
            }
            index++;
            firstIndex = nums[index];
        }

        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Wrong arguments");
    }
}

## Optimal Solution 

Using a HashMap

## Approach 

Since my original approach uses two loops with one being the index and the other
being the elements inside, I can use one loop and a HashMap that does the same exact
thing but in `O(1)` time. 

This is a backwards approach where instead of finding two numbers that add to get the 
target, I would find the complement, and store that value inside the map. 

## Solution

````java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> complements = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        int value;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            value = target - nums[i];
            if (complements.containsKey(value)) {
                return new int[]{complements.get(value), i};
            } else {
                complements.put(nums[i], i);
            }
        }
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Wrong arguments");
    }
}
