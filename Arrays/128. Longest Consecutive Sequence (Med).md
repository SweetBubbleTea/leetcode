# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

### [**Medium**]

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## Approach

Used a set in order to obtain all of the unique elements within the array and then iterate through them in a list to check for the longest streak of consecutive elements.

## My Solution

````python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        lst = list(set(nums))
        max = 0
        counter = 1
            
        lst = sorted(lst)
        
        if len(lst) == 0: 
            return 0
        
        for i in range(len(lst) - 1): 
            if lst[i] + 1 == lst[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
            else:
                if counter > max:
                    max = counter
                counter = 1
                
        if counter > max:
            max = counter   
            
        return max;
