# 229. Majority Element II

### [**Medium**]

Given an integer array of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

## Approach

Used a dictionary to store elements with their counts. If their count is more than `n/3`, then it is considered a majority element.

## My Solution

````python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        count = {}
        requirement = len(nums)//3
        answer = []
        
        for i in nums: 
            if i in count:
                count[i]+=1
            else:
                count[i] = 1
                
        for i, n in count.items():
            if n > requirement:
                answer.append(i)
                
        return answer
````
