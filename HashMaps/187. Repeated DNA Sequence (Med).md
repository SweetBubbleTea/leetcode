# 187. Repeated DNA Sequences

### [**Medium**]

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

## Approach

Use a sliding window appoarch that obtains the substring of the sequence with a length of 10. If that sequence repeated, then add it to the answer array. I will use a set in order to store the repeated sequences.

## My Solution

````python
class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        
        start = 0 
        end = 10
        count = set()
        answer = []
        
        while end <= len(s):
            seq = s[start:end]
            if seq in count: 
                if not seq in answer: 
                    answer.append(seq)
            else: 
                count.add(seq)
            start += 1
            end += 1
                
        return answer
