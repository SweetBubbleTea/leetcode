# 20. Valid Parentheses 

### [**Easy**]

Given a string s containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, 
determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

## Approach

My first stack problem. 

Information about Stacks: 
- Linear data structure 
- Flexible sizing 
- LIFO (Last In First Out)
- Think about a STACK of plates 

Code / Methods: 
- `Stack<Type> stack = new Stack();`
- `peek` -> retrieves the top of the stack (the last thing that went in)
- `push` -> adds an element to the top of the stack 
- `pop` -> removes the element at the top of the stack 


If we iterate through each character in the string and find a opening, we will push it onto the
stack. If we find a closing, we will check it with the top of the stack to see if it corresponds to the 
opening. If it does, we will remove it from the top of the stack. Keep repeating until all of the 
characters are checked. 

## My Solution

````java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        if (s.length() % 2 != 0) {
            return false; 
        }
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack(); 
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[') {
                stack.push(c); 
            } else if (c == ')' && !stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '(') {
                stack.pop(); 
            } else if (c == '}' && !stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '{') {
                stack.pop(); 
            } else if (c == ']' && !stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '[') {
                stack.pop(); 
            } else {
                return false; 
            }
        }
        
        return stack.isEmpty(); 
            
    }
}
