# 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

### [**Easy**]

Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. 
The value of each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. 
The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

## Approach

Since we do not know the size of the Linked List and were only given the `head` node,
I decided to store every node within an ArrayList, and then loop backwards from the array
in order to calculate the decimal form of the binary number. 

I don't know what I was thinking when I came up with this solution as the optimal 
solution was so clear and simple that I should be able to figure out. :(

## My Solution

````java
class Solution {
    public int getDecimalValue(ListNode head) {
        
        int items; 
        double decimal = 0; 
        
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>(); 
        
        while (head != null) {
            list.add(head.val); 
            head = head.next; 
        }
        
        items = list.size(); 
        
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
            decimal += list.get(i) * Math.pow(2,items-1); 
            items--; 
        }
        
        return (int)decimal; 
        
    }
}
