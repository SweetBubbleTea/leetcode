# 141. Linked List Cycle

### [**Easy**]

Given head, the `head` of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Approach

Similar to a transversal, I would be using a set in order to keep track of all the nodes that I have already visited. If there is a node that I had already visisted, then there is a cylce.

## My Solution

````python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        
        visited = set() 
        
        while head is not None:
            if head in visited: 
                return True
            else:
                visited.add(head)
                head = head.next 
                
        return False
